**Problem Statement** 
Student-Course Enrollment System
This system manages student information, courses offered by an institution,
and the enrollment of students in courses. It keeps track of each studentâ€™s 
enrollment year and the courses they are currently taking. Additionally, the system allows for
updates to student records, course details, and the removal of students or courses as needed.
**Database Structure**
students: Stores information about students such as their ID, first name, last name, and the year they enrolled.
courses: Stores the details of the courses, including the course name and description.
student_courses: Links students and courses to track which students are enrolled in which courses. 
This is a many-to-many relationship because a student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have many students
